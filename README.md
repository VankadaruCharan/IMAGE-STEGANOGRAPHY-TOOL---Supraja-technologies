# Image-Steganography-Tool
The project is built in Python3, a modular programming language, and uses updated functions that won't be deprecated soon. Most GUI components are platform-independent, working in any system with an integrated Development Kit (IDE). Modules like PyQt5 and Tkinter are famous and can work on any platform. This project can be used for sending private data without using third-party applications. The GUI provides a feel-good and easy understanding of the process, linking components in a jagged manner. The user can access information about the host image and data transmission amount. The project also allows embedding text file contents into the picture without manual opening. The GUI saves a cop of the stenographic image in the local system to ensure data is never lost. This project can be used as a daily "ready-to-use" software for sending private data or confidential information through Gmail without losing the message's confidentiality.
